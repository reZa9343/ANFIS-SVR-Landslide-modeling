# ANFIS-SVR-Landslide-modeling
 This project focuses on landslide susceptibility modeling using artificial intelligence algorithms such as ANFIS and SVR in the Samsami watershed, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Iran. The goal is to assess and map landslide-prone areas through spatial data analysis and machine learning techniques.
